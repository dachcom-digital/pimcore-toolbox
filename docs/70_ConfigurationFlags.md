# Configuration Flags

Sometimes we implement new features which could break the data stream / layout after updating. 
To avoid this and keep the backward compatibility promise, we've implemented the config flags.

***

Currently, no configuration flags available.
> If you're updating from 2.x/3.x to 4.x please check out old configuration flags (https://github.com/dachcom-digital/pimcore-toolbox/blob/3.x/docs/70_ConfigurationFlags.md) first!
